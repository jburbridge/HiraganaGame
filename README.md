# KanaGame
A simple browser game for practicing Kana

This is my first foray into HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so lower your expectations accordingly. I'm making this game primarily to improve my web development skills, and I plan on making regular improvements as I become more familiar with various technologies. Suggestions and improvements are welcome!
